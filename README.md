# EAE 126 Computational Aerodynamics with Matlab

Dump of Matlab code from UC Davis EAE 126 Spring 2011.
With a rare test of one of these scripts in [GNU Otave](https://octave.org), this code has not been touched since it was written.
It wasn't bug free then and still isn't.
See [eae-126-python](https://github.com/dpwiese/eae-126-python) for all of the code contained in this repository converted to Python and strongly consider not using Matlab for anything.
